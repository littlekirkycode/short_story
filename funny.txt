This file will contain a short silly funny rhyme.
But it shant contain a crime

There was a Manchester cohort,
Or once we done did thought

Steve, a lecturer, wise and kind,
A teacher of the clever mind,
With lectures that are never blind,
To the subject at hand.

His voice is deep and strong and sure,
A guide that will endure,
His jokes will make the class demure,
And laughter fill the land.

His style is one that's all his own,
A fashion sense that's quite unknown,
With ties that match and clothes that shown,
He's quite the sight to see.

But in the end, we all concur,
Though Steve may not be a fashion blur,
His lectures are quite the lure,
And learning is a joy to be.
